# WatchClosely
 
Watch Closely - is a type of puzzle horror game about monitoring live surveillance camera footage and spotting anomalies. (Referenced to I'm On Observation Duty)
Currently there is only one level - House. Next level in development is Museum, where you will have additional work in the form of observing an anomalous exhibit, which can complicate, if not make it impossible to pass the level.
